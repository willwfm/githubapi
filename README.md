This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### About

This project was developed using React, it searches for users of GitHub by 'username' and searches its repositories.<br>
We have two examples to get this data from the api, one using javascript fetch and another using graphql <br>
Authenticating with GitHub Apps to have more requests limits the GitHub apis, without authentication can make 60 requests per hour, while authenticated this limit is 5000 request per hour <br>
(https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting)
